Chatty
=====================

Welcome to ChattyApp 
  - A group messaging system based off of features offered in Slack. Chatty was build using JavaScript, ReactJS and  a websocket server to update users in real-time.
  - Users of Chatty will be able to send messages to a message board where they will be broadcasted to the rest of the current active users
  - Users are named anonymous unless they decide to change their username for their current session. Picking a username will change the color of their name within the message board. Colors and usernames are only active during their session and reset once refreshed or exited.
